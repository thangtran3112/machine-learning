## [Install GPU Drivers and Libraries](https://medium.com/@gokulprasath100702/a-guide-to-enabling-cuda-and-cudnn-for-tensorflow-on-windows-11-a89ce11863f1)

1. [Read compatibility of Nvidia matrix for each GPU](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/cudnn/latest/reference/support-matrix.html#support-matrix). At this moment, tensorflow 2.17 only works with `CUDA 11.8` and its corresponding `cuDNN`
2. **Install NVIDIA GPU Driver**: Ensure you have the latest NVIDIA GPU driver installed.
3. **Install CUDA Toolkit**: Download and install the CUDA Toolkit from the [NVIDIA website](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).
4. **Install cuDNN**: Download and install cuDNN from the [NVIDIA website](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn).
5. In order for CUDA toolkit to work, we must also install Visual Studio with `Desktop development with C++`. [See guideline here](https://medium.com/@gokulprasath100702/a-guide-to-enabling-cuda-and-cudnn-for-tensorflow-on-windows-11-a89ce11863f1)

## Step 2: Install TensorFlow with GPU Support

Install TensorFlow with GPU support using pip:

```sh
pip install tensorflow-gpu
```

## Step 3: Verify TensorFlow is Using the GPU

You can verify that TensorFlow is using the GPU by running the following code:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Check if TensorFlow is built with GPU support
print("Built with GPU support:", tf.test.is_built_with_cuda())

# List available devices
print("Available devices:")
for device in tf.config.list_physical_devices():
    print(device)

# Check if a GPU is available
print("GPU available:", tf.test.is_gpu_available())
```

## Example Code to Run on GPU

Here is an example of how to ensure your Keras model runs on the GPU:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Input

# Ensure TensorFlow uses the GPU
physical_devices = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if physical_devices:
    try:
        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(physical_devices[0], True)
        print("GPU is available and configured.")
    except RuntimeError as e:
        print(e)
```
