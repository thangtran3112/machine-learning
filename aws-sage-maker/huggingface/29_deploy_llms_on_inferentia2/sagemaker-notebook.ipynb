    "In this example, we will deploy [Hugging Face Zephyr](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta) to Amazon SageMaker.

    "To make it easier for customers to utilize the full power of Inferentia2, we created a [neuron model cache](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum-neuron/guides/cache_system), which contains pre-compiled configurations for the most popular LLMs. A cached configuration is defined through a model architecture (Mistral), model size (7B), neuron version (2.16), number of inferentia cores (2), batch size (2), and sequence length (2048).  \n",

We update the blog here once released._\n",
